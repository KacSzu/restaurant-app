# Restaurant app

This application addresses various challenges in the restaurant industry by streamlining the order management process.<br>
Users are categorized into three roles: Admin, Waiter, and Kitchen, each playing a crucial role in the seamless flow of orders.<br>
This application is optimized for tablet use.

## 1. Waiter Role:

Waiters initiate the order creation process by adding selected items to the cart.<br>
Once the items are chosen, they can create an order with the status "waiting."

## 2. Kitchen Role:

Orders in the "waiting" status are then directed to the Kitchen user.<br>
The Kitchen user has the ability to update the order status to "ready" upon completion.<br>
Additionally, the Kitchen user can mark specific products as "sold out" to manage inventory effectively.

## 3. Waiter Role (again):

The order with a "ready" status is now ready to be served.<br>
The Waiter takes charge, serving the dish to the customer and updating the order status to "done."

## 4. Admin Role:

Admins have access to a dashboard featuring sales statistics.<br>

They can edit the menu, ensuring it remains up-to-date and relevant.<br>

The Admin role extends to user management, allowing the creation of new users as needed.
