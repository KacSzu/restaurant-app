# Restaurant app

This application addresses various challenges in the restaurant industry by streamlining the order management process. Users are categorized into three roles: Admin, Waiter, and Kitchen, each playing a crucial role in the seamless flow of orders.

## 1. Waiter Role:

Waiters initiate the order creation process by adding selected items to the cart.
Once the items are chosen, they can create an order with the status "waiting."

## 2. Kitchen Role:

Orders in the "waiting" status are then directed to the Kitchen user.
The Kitchen user has the ability to update the order status to "ready" upon completion.
Additionally, the Kitchen user can mark specific products as "sold out" to manage inventory effectively.

## 3. Waiter Role (again):

The order with a "ready" status is now ready to be served.
The Waiter takes charge, serving the dish to the customer and updating the order status to "done."

## 4. Admin Role:

Admins have access to a dashboard featuring sales statistics.
They can edit the menu, ensuring it remains up-to-date and relevant.
The Admin role extends to user management, allowing the creation of new users as needed.
